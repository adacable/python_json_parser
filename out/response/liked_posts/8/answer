<p>He wanted the group to leave him behind so he could stay with all this information, be buried with it, so he told them to leave him to die.  Sand surrounded him on all sides, pressing him down, squeezing his limbs.  As it crawled up his neck, entering his mouth, he realized the error of his decision.  If he was dead, then all he knew would be wasted!</p>
<p>Terrified, he cried out to Wan Shi Tong, telling the spirit to take pity on him.  The owl decided to save his life because he was a man of knowledge, not war, and took him to the spirit world where he was safe and free to pursue his studies.</p>
<p>There, he learned many interesting and peaceful things, but the feeling of remorse in his body turned to that of unbridled rage at the Avatar and his friends because they had just given up on him so easily and left him to die.  He learned many brutal techniques after that from beings in the spirit world and traded his face for knowledge from the spirit Koh before returning to the real world from the spirit world to beat down the Avatar.  Because of his time in the spirit world, he is now a spirit himself.</p>
<p>He discovered that he was too late, however, and changes his mission:  Take out all the benders in the world using the wisdom he has learned from the spirits.  High on his list is Korra, the reincarnation of the previous Avatar.  If he can&#8217;t kill Aang, then she&#8217;s the next best person to mess with.</p>
<p>Zei is gonna fuck shit up.</p>
