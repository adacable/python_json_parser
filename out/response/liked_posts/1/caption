<p><strong><br/>Windswept by Charles Sowers </strong></p>
<p>Art installation fixed outside a gallery’s wall, displaying natural flow and turbulence of the wind </p>
<p>Hundreds of spinning blades reveal the invisible patterns of the wind in American artist <a href="http://charlessowers.com/" target="_blank">Charles Sowers’</a> kinetic installation on the facade of the <a href="http://www.randallmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Randall Museum</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The installation, titled Windswept, consists of 612 rotating aluminium weather vanes mounted on an outside wall. As gusts of wind hit the wall, the aluminium blades spin not as one but independently, indicating the localised flow of the wind and the way it interacts with the building.</p>
<p>“Our ordinary experience of wind is as a solitary sample point of a very large invisible phenomenon,” said Sowers. “Windswept is a kind of large sensor array that samples the wind at its point of interaction with the Randall Museum building and reveals the complexity and structure of that interaction.”</p>
